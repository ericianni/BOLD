# Weekly Reporting
## Motivation
Often times when we are working on a project we develop tunnel vision. We become fixated on the that which is immediately at hand and risk losing track of the bigger picture. One way of protecting ourselves against this is to conduct regular self-reflections. By taking a step back to examine what we are doing we afford ourselves the opportunity to reset our perspective.

When doing this self-reflection we should examine what we are doing fits in the bigger picture and how what we have learned thus far changes where we think we will end up. Typically this will help ensure we are not going off track and to catch potential problems before it is too late to do anything about them.

Furthermore, by writing down these reflections and sharing them with us we are able to share our experience with project management directly with you. Working together we can inrease the probability of success while reducing any obstacles along the way. 
## What to do
After the planning phase is complete you will share a brief status check with us each week. Below you will find three questions which need to be answered and submitted to Canvas. These are fairly informal, but that does not mean they are not important. Therefore, give these reports the attention they deserve. This will be the number one way you will communicate your progress to us.

Weekly Reporting Questions:
1. What have you done this week?
2. What challenges have you faced and how did you handle them this week?
3. Currently, do you expect your final project to differ from the initial plan?
