# Final Deliverable(s)
# Motivation
Part of the requirements for participating in the Fellowship is delivering a final project for use as an Open Education resource. Without your final delivery of your project there is no way for other educators/students to make use of your work.
# What to do
When you created your Project Plans we asked you to enumerate exactly what you would be _delivering_ at the conclusion of the Fellowship. This means each project will have different delivery requirements but there a few things that should be included for all projects. 
* README - Use this document to briefly describe the items that are being included in your final submission. For exmaple, if your project consists of a series of videos use the README to highlight what each covers. Another example, if your project involves written learning content you should provide a summary of each "lesson." 
* Instructions - If your project includes software/tools that require running you need to include any "usage instructions" users may need in order to actually utilize your work. You should assume the user has no expert knowledge and therefore your instructions should be aimed at complete novices.
* Project Files - What is included here depends on your project. If you created a piece of software you need to include your source code. If you created learning content you need to submit your content files (even if they are hosted somewhere else). If you conducted research you need to provide all the surveys/interview questions and the results along with the analysis. It is best to err on the side of including _too_ much. Remember, these files are what other educators/learners will rely on to make use of your project.

Please include all these in a _zip_ file submitted to Canvas.
