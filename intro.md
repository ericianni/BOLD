# Introduction
While this fellowship is (typically) an insular journey, it doesn't mean we cannot have a community that both supports and provides feedback. With this in mind please take a moment to introduce yourself to the cohort on Teams. To help you formulate your introduction, please consider using the following questions.
* What is your name?
* What is your degree and area of study?
* What do you do when not being a student? (Career, hobbies, etc.)
* What do you hope to accomplish with this fellowship?
* What is something interesting about you?
