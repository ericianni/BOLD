# Final Presentation
## Motivation
You have spent 20 weeks working on a project. You have likely had to make sacrafices for this Fellowhip. It would be a terrible shame if all that time and effort went unnoticed.

## What to do
With this in mind, we are asking you to create a short (~5-10 minutes) video presentation where you cover the following:
* Overview of the project
  * Problem Statement
  * Brief look at existing solutions to justify the need
* Proposed Solution
* Work Completed
  * Any challenges you faced and changes required to your plan
* Reflection
  * How well do you believe you accomplished what you set out to do?
  * What opportunities of future work exist?

We are not expecting professinoal quality video/sound editing, but you should attempt to be professional when it comes to content. You will need to host these videos online somewhere of your choosing (e.g. YouTube). You will then submit to Canvas the URL to your presentation.
