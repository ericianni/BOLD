# Peer Feedback
## Motivation
We apologize if we sound like a broken record, but we cannot stress enough the importance of reflection while working on a project. Thus far we have discussed reflecting during Weekly Reporting and the Milestones. Now it is time for you to help your fellow fellows by providing them feedback on their work. As an "outsider" you are perfectly positioned to notice things that your peer may have missed due to natural tunnel vision. 
## What to do
After everyone submits their milestones you will automatically be assigned peers to review. You need to watch the presentation provided and, if appropriate, examine or "test" any work-in-progress provided. You will then need to provide written feedback for each project you are assigned. When giving feedback consider the following:

* Most people struggle with receiving feedback because they fear being judged. It is important to frame your feedback in a positive light and provide constructive critiques, not just "this is wrong."
* What has your peer done well thus far?
* What potential issues do you see with the direction the project is going? Do you have any suggestions for avoiding those issues?
* Does the work thus far match with the stated purpose of the project? If not, where are the discrepencies and how might your peer address them?
