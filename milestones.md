# Milestones
## Motivation
Earlier we have discussed the need for Weekly Reporting and the importance of periodic self-reflection. These reports are beneficial as they allow you to place your current work in the context of the whole. They also allow you to receive feedback from us. 

While self-reflection is crucial to any project, it has a large flaw: you. Relying on a single data point is always a risky proposition. Therefore we should _also_ seek out additional feedback. In the "real world" this can take many forms:

* focus groups
* A/B testing
* client reviews

For this program, you will be relyingo on your fellow...er...fellows...to provide you with new perspectives. In order to accomplish this, you will need to share your project with your peers. Since we cannot expect everyone to instinctively understand the work you are doing some sort of "overview" is in order. You will accomplish this via a short presentation video.

## What to do
Twice during this program you will need to create a short (~5-10 minutes) video presentation where you cover the following:

* a brief overview of the project goal
* a description of the work completed thus far
* a discussion of any challenges/problems encountered and what you have done to overcome them
* a demo/walkthrough of your work (if appropriate for your project)
* a description of the specific feedback you would like from your peers

You will need to host these videos online somewhere of your choosing (e.g. YouTube). You will then submit to Canvas the URL to your presentation. These links will be shared with the cohort in order for them to provide Peer Feedback.
