# Task List
## Motivation
Once we have an overview of what we intend on doing we need to ponder the steps required to bring our vision into reality. No matter how good our idea is, if we don't itemize the tasks that are required to move from Point A to Point B we are destined to fail. The Task List you produce here will act as your divining rod and will keep you pointed in the right direction. You will also reference your tasks during your Weekly Reporting.

## What to do
Now that you have a clear Problem Statement and Deliverable it is time to fill in the space between. You need to start by breaking up the project into large "chunks." These chunks, or components, should then be broken down into smaller and smaller tasks until no task is estimated to take more than 5 hours each. You will then take each of these tasks, assign them a number of hours to accomplish, and then schedule them out over the course of the program. 

Let's take a look at an example. Imagine we are creating a mobile app to use computer vision to identify objects in the real world and translate them into a new language. What are some "chunks" we can identify?

* Pre-coding (Task 1)
  * Locate and evaluate possible computer vision frameworks. (Task 1.1)
  * Decide if using a pre-trained model is better than training one ourself. (Task 1.2)
  * Determine the best mobile app development framework. (Task 1.3)
  * Create wife-frames for the app and a flowchart describing a typical user experience. (Task 1.4)
* Mobile App Programming (Task 2)
  * Learn how to create apps using chosen framework. (Task 2.1)
  * Create a proof-of-concept app that links the computer vision model to the app front end. (Task 2.2)
  * Build out the different mobile pages required. (Task 2.3)
    * Landing Page (Task 2.3.1)
    * Options Screen (Task 2.3.2)
    * Augmented Reality portion (Task 2.3.4)
* Testing (Task 3)
  * Test the accuracy of the computer vision (Task 3.1)
  * Test the accuracy of the translations (Task 3.2)
  * Test the user experience (Task 3.3)

This is just a very quick example of how to break up a project into large components with some sub-tasks. Many of these sub-tasks can be further broken up as needed. In your actual plan you will break up the tasks much more. It is important to be as detailed as possible with these tasks as this is what you will be referencing in your Weekly Reporting. Each week you will need to tell us what you planned on accomplishing, which should come directly from this Task List. We highly recommend you lable your tasks in some sort of identifiable way as demonstrated above. This will make your Weekly Reporting much easier to write if you can mention specific tasks by number. 

Please use the supplied Excel template when crafting your Task List. Each week has slots for up to 4 tasks. Don't feel you are required to have 4 tasks each week. Likewise don't feel you are _limited_ to just 4 tasks a week. You are free to add or remove rows from any given week in the template; just don't remove weeks.
