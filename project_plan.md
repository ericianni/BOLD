# Project Plan
## Motivation
Let's begin with a cliche to put is the right fame of mind.

> Success is 90% preperation and 10% execution

While it is sometimes fun to roll our eyes at cliches, they usually exist for a reason and this is no exception. When it comes to projects, planning is perhaps the most important step of the process. To use military parlance, planning is a _force multiplier_. Each minute of planning can save us hours of trouble later.

How many times have we been over eager to jump right into a task only to realize too late that we made some poor assumptions about how things will go? Without planning we could find ourselves having to rework our project on the fly which may mean throwing out weeks worth of work or added tasks we didn't schedule for!

For this program we are going to ask you to start from absolutely zero assumptions. This means that you cannot even assume your project is worth pursuing. You will also need to break down any proposed project into a series of smaller tasks. Both of these steps are crucial for success. Without a clear expression of why the project is worth doing you risk losing focus. Without a clear breakdown of the required work you risk overlooking some crucial aspect of what needs doing.

## What to do

For this task, we are going to ask you to produce a detailed project plan. Each part of the plan is designed to increase your chances of success so make sure you give them the attention they deserve. Your plan will include the following:

* Problem Statement
* Related Works
* Proposed Work
* Deliverables
* Task List
### Problem Statement
This is perhaps the most important part of any project plan. Here you will need to justify the _need_ for your proposed project. This may seem an unnecessary burden, but if you cannot demonstrate that there exists a problem in need of solving why even bother spending months working on a solution?

While it may seem simple to identify a need it is actually very hard to distill. It is probably best to look at an example project idea.

> An online resource for high school students learning Latin.

What is the need this project is designed to address? Perhaps you are thinking:

> Unlike learners of other langauges, Latin students are stuck learning soley from textbooks. 

While this may be true, this is not a good _Problem Statement_. It focuses on the _lack of a solution_ instead of the _need_ the solution is meant to solve. To be explicit: **lack of a solution to a problem is not itself a problem**. So what _would_ be a good Problem Statement?

> While Latin shares some similarities with English vocabulary, learners still struggle to grasp the complex syntax and grammar.

What makes this better? Notice there is no mention of a possible solution. It focuses exclusively on the need: _a way to help students learn Latin syntax and grammar_. 

Now that we better understand what a Problem Statement entails, let's examine how we get here. As master or doctoral student you should all be intimately aware that no statement can ever exist without _evidence_. Therefore for your Problem Statement
