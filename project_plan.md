# Project Plan
## Motivation
Let's begin with a cliche to put is the right fame of mind.

> Success is 90% preperation and 10% execution

While it is sometimes fun to roll our eyes at cliches, they usually exist for a reason and this is no exception. When it comes to projects, planning is perhaps the most important step of the process. To use military parlance, planning is a _force multiplier_. Each minute of planning can save us hours of trouble later.

How many times have we been over eager to jump right into a task only to realize too late that we made some poor assumptions about how things will go? Without planning we could find ourselves having to rework our project on the fly which may mean throwing out weeks worth of work or added tasks we didn't schedule for!

For this program we are going to ask you to start from absolutely zero assumptions. This means that you cannot even assume your project is worth pursuing. You will also need to break down any proposed project into a series of smaller tasks. Both of these steps are crucial for success. Without a clear expression of why the project is worth doing you risk losing focus. Without a clear breakdown of the required work you risk overlooking some crucial aspect of what needs doing.

## What to do

For this task, we are going to ask you to produce a detailed project plan. Each part of the plan is designed to increase your chances of success so make sure you give them the attention they deserve. Your plan will include the following:

* Problem Statement
* Related Works
* Proposed Work
* Deliverables
* Task List
### Problem Statement
This is perhaps the most important part of any project plan. Here you will need to justify the _need_ for your proposed project. This may seem an unnecessary burden, but if you cannot demonstrate that there exists a problem in need of solving why even bother spending months working on a solution?

While it may seem simple to identify a need it is actually very hard to distill. It is probably best to look at an example project idea.

> An online resource for high school students learning Latin.

What is the need this project is designed to address? Perhaps you are thinking:

> Unlike learners of other langauges, Latin students are stuck learning soley from textbooks. 

While this may be true, this is not a good _Problem Statement_. It focuses on the _lack of a solution_ instead of the _need_ the solution is meant to solve. To be explicit: **lack of a solution to a problem is not itself a problem**. So what _would_ be a good Problem Statement?

> While Latin shares some similarities with English vocabulary, learners still struggle to grasp the complex syntax and grammar.

What makes this better? Notice there is no mention of a possible solution. It focuses exclusively on the need: _a way to help students learn Latin syntax and grammar_. 

Now that we better understand what a Problem Statement entails, let's examine how we get here. As master or doctoral student you should all be intimately aware that no statement can ever exist without _evidence_. Therefore for your Problem Statement needs to be supported in _some fashion_ by research. We are not asking you to engage in any deep research, but you need to have some evidence that this need does in fact exist.

### Related Works
Now that we have a solid Problem Statement, we need to examine how others have attempted to solve this problem. This typically involves identifying and analyzing solutions to the same problem you identified above. The reason this is important is because we do not want to spend months working on solving a problem that has been addressed already.

Does this mean that your project cannot proceed if the need already has available solutions? Absolutely not! During your examination of existing solutions you will be highlight what works well, but more pertinent to this plan what could use some work. As long as your solution approaches the problem in a new or improved way you are good to go!

When looking for existing solutions many students will come to a conclusion "There doesn't exist a solution to this particular problem." We can almost guarantee you that is not the case. Typically this happens when students don't have a targeted Problem Statement. For example, imagine the following Problem Statement:

> There does not exist a mobile app teaching elementary school students financial literacy

Based on the discussion above, we can clearly see this Problem Statement is not well defined. It frames the problem as a lack of a solution, but remember a solution is meant to fix a problem so how can a lack of a solution be itself the problem needing solving? If the student then tries to find existing solutions to the problem (lack of a mobile app) they are not likely to find any.

In reality the problem is _the lack of financial literacy among elementary school students_. This is actually something we can find existing solutions for as there are many books, courses, or lessons designed explicitly to solve this problem. So when looking for existing solutions make sure you are also examining solutions that aren't attempting to solve the problem in the same way.

### Proposed Work
This is likely to be the "meat" of your plan. Here you will describe in detail your proposed solution to the above problem. What you will need to include here will completely depend on what your project is attempting to do. Start with a brief overview of your project. What what will it "do?" Who is the target audience(s)?

Next you need to describe the required components of your project. Again, this will depend greatly on your idea. For example, if you are making a website you should describe your tech stack and the different front end and back end components and how they will interact. Diagrams and wireframes in this section will go a long way to help the reader understand what you intend to accomplish.

During this discussion you need to examine the reasons behind your design choices. If you are creating a lesson to teach something, you should consider which pedagougies you will use and why. If you are creating a flashcard app you need to justify your design decisions with some sort of rationale (e.g. using established UX theories). While this may seem tedious, it is important for us to examine the _why_ we are doing something in a particular way as this will lead to a better solution to the problem.

### Deliverables
This is where you lay out how you will measure your success. What benchmarks or criteria do you have for the finished "product?" Here are some things to consider (not all apply to all projects):

* What is the exact feature set?
* What actions will a user be able to do?
* How many lessons will be included and what are the subjects?
* What type of documentation will be required for people to use your project?

Make sure you put a decent amount of time into enumerating the particulars of your deliverable. This is the "goal post" that we are striving for and it is how you will measure your success. The better picture you have of the final product the better you will be able to see a path to your destination.

### Task List

This will be a separate submission on Canvas, but it is part of the plan so we are including it here. Now that you have a clear Problem Statement and Deliverable it is time to fill in the space between. You need to start by breaking up the project into large "chunks." These chunks, or components, should then be broken down into smaller and smaller tasks until no task is estimated to take more than 5 hours each. You will then take each of these tasks, assign them a number of hours to accomplish, and then schedule them out over the course of the program. 

Let's take a look at an example. Imagine we are creating a mobile app to use computer vision to identify objects in the real world and translate them into a new language. What are some "chunks" we can identify?

* Pre-coding
  * Locate and evaluate possible computer vision frameworks.
  * Decide if using a pre-trained model is better than training one ourself.
  * Determine the best mobile app development framework.
  * Create wife-frames for the app and a flowchart describing a typical user experience.
* Mobile App Programming
  * Learn how to create apps using chosen framework.
  * Create a proof-of-concept app that links the computer vision model to the app front end.
  * Build out the different mobile pages required.
    * Landing Page
    * Options Screen
    * Augmented Reality portion
* Testing
  * Test the accuracy of the computer vision
  * Test the accuracy of the translations
  * Test the user experience

This is just a very quick example of how to break up a project into large components with some sub-tasks. Still, many of these sub-tasks can be further broken up as needed. It is important to be as detailed as possible with these tasks as this is what you will be referencing in your Weekly Reporting. Each week you will need to tell us what you planned on accomplishing, which should come directly from this Task List. 

## Let's put a bow on it!
That was quite a bit of information that we just threw at you. We highly recommend you go back and reread this page. While writing your plan you should revisit each section's description to ensure you are on track.

If you are anything like us you may find such a detailed plan constricting without any room for flexibility. To help assuage your fears let's end with another cliche.

> No plan survives first contact with the enemy.

Hopefully you took the time to really consider all the aspects of your project plan so there isn't too much change required. That said, nothing you write in this plan is 100% binding. _All_ plans change and that is fine and expected. The goal with spending the time on this plan is that any changes are likely to be minor, but even major issues can be resolved, just let us know what is going on and we will help you figure out options.
