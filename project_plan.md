# Project Plan
## Motivation
Let's begin with a cliche to put is the right fame of mind.

> Success is 90% preperation and 10% execution

While it is sometimes fun to roll our eyes at cliches, they usually exist for a reason and this is no exception. When it comes to projects, planning is perhaps the most important step of the process. To use military parlance, planning is a _force multiplier_. Each minute of planning can save us hours of trouble later.

How many times have we been over eager to jump right into a task only to realize too late that we made some poor assumptions about how things will go? Without planning we could find ourselves having to rework our project on the fly which may mean throwing out weeks worth of work or added tasks we didn't schedule for!

For this program we are going to ask you to start from absolutely zero assumptions. This means that before you can even begin designing your project, you need to:

* justify the need for your proposed project (Problem Statement). 
* demonstrate that you are "reinventing the wheel" by examining existing solutions to the identified need (Related Works).
