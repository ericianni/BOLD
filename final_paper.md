# Final Paper
## Motivation
Congratulations! If you are setting out to write your Final Paper it means you have made it to the end of your Fellowship! For over 5 months you have tirelessly dedicated yourself to your project. All the status checks, presenations, and meetings have culminated in something we hope you are proud of! With that in mind, it is time to share it with the world! 
## What to do
For this task you should consider it an expansion of your Project Plan you write back at the start of the Fellowship. Depending on how you wrote your initial plan you may be able to reuse (with limited rewrites) much of the previous paper (see bolded sections below).
* **Problem Statement**
* **Related Works**
* **Solution**
* Work Completed
* Future Work
### Problem Statement
This is perhaps the most important part of any project plan. Here you will need to justify the _need_ for your proposed project. This may seem an unnecessary burden, but if you cannot demonstrate that there exists a problem in need of solving why did you bother spending months working on a solution?

### Related Works
The problem statement is just the start. Now we need to examine how others have attempted to solve this problem. This typically involves identifying and analyzing solutions to the same problem you identified above. The reason this is important is helps put the work you completed into context of the field as a whole.

This section should have been part of your Project Plan and may not need much updating, but if you received feedback that your initial Problem Statement was not specific enough, then you may want to re-examine the solutions you highlighted. The goal should be to let the reader identify how your work fits into the broader field in general.

### Solution (Proposed Work from the Project Plan)
Here you will describe in detail your proposed solution to the above problem. What you will need to include here will completely depend on what your project is set out to do. Start with a brief overview of your project. What what does it "do?" Who is the target audience(s)?

Next you need to describe the required components of your project. Again, this will depend greatly on your idea. For example, if you made a website you should describe your tech stack and the different front end and back end components and how they interact. Diagrams and wireframes in this section will go a long way to help the reader understand what you intend to accomplish.

During this discussion you need to examine the reasons behind your design choices. If you created a lesson to teach something, you should consider which pedagougies you used and why. If you created a flashcard app you need to justify your design decisions with some sort of rationale (e.g. using established UX theories). While this may seem tedious, it is important for us to examine the _why_ we are did something in a particular way as this will lead to a better solution to the problem.

### Work Completed
This section covers the development of the actual project. You should take time to reflect on how your plans have changed over the course of the development. Why were these changes necessary? How do they affect the final project?

This section also should incorporate an evaluation of the final project. Some fellows use surveys, interviews, and/or observations to gather feedback. If you do use these methods to gather data, please make sure you discuss the methodology and results. Then reflect on if this data indicates that  your project successfully addressed the Problem Statement. If you didn't use any form of external evaluation you should still reflect on the work completed in a similar manner.

### Future Work
As is the case with most things in life (ourselves included) your project likely isn't "done." When making your Project Plan you had to consider the available time in order to complete the work. This typically meant judiciously limiting the scope of the project. 

In this section spend some time imagining a world where time and resources are of no consequence. Now consider what you would change/add to your project and why.

## Wrapping it all up
We know that many of you are exhausted and frazzled after trying to balance your other obligations with this Fellowship and that last thing you want to do is write one more paper. With that said, it is very important that we finish strong. This paper provides an opportunity to reflect on all that you have accomplished. We promise you that you will gain deeper insights into your work that can be carried forward in life to your future endeavours. 

This paper also gives you an opportunity to showcase your efforts over the past 20 weeks. It would be a terrible shame if all that work was not shared with the world! The paper could be the difference between someone deciding to incoroporate your work into their teaching/program or not. Keep in mind that the purpose of this Fellowship is to produce projects that will be _used_ by other educators.
